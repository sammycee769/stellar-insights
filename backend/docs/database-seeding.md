# Database Seeding Guide

## Overview

The seeding system provides realistic development data for all major entities in the database. It is designed to be **idempotent** — running it multiple times will not create duplicate records.

| File                                                 | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `backend/seed_data.sh`                               | Main seeding script (direct SQLite) |
| `backend/migrations/030_comprehensive_seed_data.sql` | SQL seed data for all entities      |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run migrations first (if not already done)
sqlx migrate run

# Seed the database
./seed_data.sh .stellar_insights.db

# Reset and re-seed
./seed_data.sh .stellar_insights.db --reset
```

## Idempotency

All inserts use `INSERT OR IGNORE` so re-running the script is safe. Existing records are never overwritten.

To force a full reset:

```bash
./seed_data.sh .stellar_insights.db --reset
```

This deletes all seed records (identified by their prefixed IDs) and re-inserts them.

---

## Verification Queries

```bash
# Count all seeded anchors
sqlite3 .stellar_insights.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM anchors WHERE id LIKE 'anchor-%';"

# View anchors by status
sqlite3 .stellar_insights.db "SELECT name, status, reliability_score FROM anchors WHERE id LIKE 'anchor-%' ORDER BY reliability_score DESC;"

# View corridors
sqlite3 .stellar_insights.db "SELECT source_asset_code, destination_asset_code, reliability_score, status FROM corridors WHERE id LIKE 'corridor-%';"

# View recent metrics history
sqlite3 .stellar_insights.db "SELECT anchor_id, timestamp, success_rate FROM anchor_metrics_history WHERE anchor_id LIKE 'anchor-%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# View governance proposals
sqlite3 .stellar_insights.db "SELECT title, status FROM governance_proposals WHERE created_by LIKE 'GPROPOSER%';"
```

---

## CI Integration

To run seeding in CI, add this step after migrations:

```yaml
- name: Seed database
  run: ./backend/seed_data.sh ${{ env.DB_PATH }}
```

---

## Adding New Seed Data

1. Add `INSERT OR IGNORE` statements to `backend/migrations/030_comprehensive_seed_data.sql`
2. Use a consistent ID prefix (e.g. `anchor-`, `corridor-`, `asset-`) so the `--reset` flag can clean them up
3. Update this document with the new records
4. Test idempotency by running the script twice
